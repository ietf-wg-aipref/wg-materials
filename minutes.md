### You've agreed to take minutes for an AI Preferences Working Group meeting.

#### Thanks!

We have four guidelines that will help you take excellent minutes:

1. Use **Markdown**. If you're not familiar with this format, see [this quick primer](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/).
2. **Identify each topic** with a new header.
3. **Give each speaker a new paragraph**, and identify them at the start.
4. It's good to capture the general gist of discussion, but **it's critical to capture decisions**.

Your minutes should look something like this:

    ## FooBar Spec Issue 23: use of the word "blah"
    
    Brian: Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
    
    Barry: Blah.
    
    Bruce: Blah, blah blah BLAH BLAH BLAH.
    
    The working group decided to "blah."
    
    ## FooBar Spec Issue 42: widgets

(and so on)

_Feel free to interrupt the discussion if you need clarification, someone's name, or just more time to write._
